## What is ReadMETRICS ?

**ReadMETRICS** is a new turnkey solution for :

<list :items="features"></list>

It is based on the already existing and field-tested [ezPAARSE](https://www.ezpaarse.org/) and [ezMESURE](https://ezmesure.couperin.org/) Free and Open Source tools, extending and including features inspired by the [National Library of Luxembourg](https://bnl.public.lu/fr.html)â€™s transition to Open Access, described [here](https://www.consortium.lu/?page_id=6334).

## ezPAARSE

An [open-source software](https://github.com/ezpaarse-project/ezpaarse/) that can ingest your (proxy) log files and show how users access subscribed electronic resources. It filters, extracts and enriches the access events that were spotted and produces a result file that ezMESURE can ingest and display in a dashboard.

## ezMESURE

An [open-source software](https://github.com/ezpaarse-project/ezmesure/) built upon [Elastic and Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/fr/) to assemble a repository centralizing the usage statistics data produced by one or many instances of ezPAARSE. It is also able to ingest [COUNTER5](https://www.projectcounter.org/code-of-practice-five-sections/abstract/) data.
